# YouTube Nonstop - Chrome Extension

Annoyed at YouTube for interrupting your videos every so often? This lightweight extension bypasses the pop up when it asks if you're still watching. Highly recommended to use an adblocker such as Ublock Origin alongside this extension for uninterrupted play.

## Installation

- Download the zip file under `<> Code` OR run this command in your terminal to clone the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/Andrew32A/youtube-nonstop-extension.git`
- Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
- Enable Developer Mode on the top right
- Click "Load Unpacked" on the top left
- Select the folder you cloned the repository to
- You're done! Now you can watch YouTube without interruptions

## Notes

- The YouTube tab must be active for the extension to work properly unfortunately
- Currently only tested for Windows, but should work for Mac and Linux as well
